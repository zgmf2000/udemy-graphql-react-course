## About
This repository is made for the following Udemy course:

Just as the name implies, this repository utilizes ExpressJS and GraphQL as the main technology stack.

## How to Run
1. Run both the server and the GraphQL application: 
   - For the server, we are using `JSON Server`. Run `npm run json:server` to start the server.
   
   - For the GraphQL app, run one of the following:  
     - `npm run start` - Run for production.  
     - `npm run dev` - Run for development, using `nodemon`.
2. Open `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
3. You can use GraphiQL's comprehensive, self-updating documentation to play with the server.
